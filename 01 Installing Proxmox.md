### **NOTES**
üö® Proxmox and Wi-Fi Connection  
By default, **Proxmox VE does not provide built-in support for Wi-Fi**, as it is designed to run on servers that typically use a **stable LAN (Ethernet) connection**. Therefore, using a **wired (LAN) connection** is highly recommended for the best performance and full compatibility with Proxmox features such as **clustering, storage sharing, and network bridging**.  

However, if you want to use Wi-Fi on Proxmox, you will need to configure it manually. A complete guide on **how to set up Wi-Fi on Proxmox VE** can be found on the following GitHub repository:  

üìå **[[10 Additional Wifi Configuration]](https://github.com/ikhlashr-workspace/Hypervisor-Proxmox/blob/main/10%20Additional%20Wifi%20Configuration.md)** 


Please note that using **Wi-Fi for virtualization and production servers is not recommended**, mainly due to **high latency, network instability, and lower throughput compared to Ethernet**. üöÄ
